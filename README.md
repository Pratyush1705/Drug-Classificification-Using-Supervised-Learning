# Drug-Classificification-Using-Supervised-Learning
In this code we are trying to collect patient data like Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol and Sodium potassium levels
And based on the data we are trying to give the best medication to the illness. The input is a csv which contains the prerecorded patient data 
along with the medication provided. We are going to create a model which learns from this data. Firstly we will build a decision tree and 
then train the model using XGBoost Algorithm and then use it to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to prescribe a drug to a new patient.

Hope everyone finds it useful.Thank you! Gracias!
